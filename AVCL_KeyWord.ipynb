        "hey there how's it going everybody in this video we'll be learning how to work with numeric data in Python and numbers are most commonly represented with integers and floats and the difference between an integer and a float is that an integer is a whole number and a float as a decimal so to see an example of this let's create a variable called num and let's just set this equal to 3 now python has a built-in function called type where we can see the data type of an object so if we print out the type of num and run this and we can see that it returns that that is of the class integer now if we were to set this number instead to 3.14 and now rerun this and we can see that now the type of number is a float so that's the main difference between an integer and a float now when working with numeric data it's common that you'll need to use some basic arithmetic so let me grab some comments from my snippets here just so that we have a reference for everything that we can do so I'll copy these arithmetic operators and paste these in and now let's go ahead and just run through each of these so the first four we've likely already seen a lot and are familiar with so for example addition we if we print it out 3 plus 2 and we can expect that equal to 5 if we print out 3 minus 2 that should be 1/3 times 2 should be equal to 6 and 3 divided by 2 should be equal to 1.5 now for division to behave this way this is actually new in Python 3 if you're running Python 2 then this will actually equal 1 because it drops the decimal but in Python 3 that gives us the right answer of 1.5 now if we don't want to drop that decimal then we do have a floor division and for division can be performed by adding 2 division signs so if I run this and now we can see it drops that decimal and it's equal to 1 so if you ever see these 2 division signs then that is this floor division now if you wanted to work with exponents and powers and we can use these 2 multiplication signs so if we wanted to print 3 to the second power then we could just say 3 with these two multiplication signs if I print that then we can see that that equals nine because three squared is equal to nine now this last operator here is called a modulo operator and it gives us the remainder after a division so three mod two will have a remainder of 1 because 2 goes into 3 once with one left over so if we say 3 mod 2 and run that we can see that that is equal to 1 now a common use case for this is to tell if a number is even or odd now the reason for this is because every time you divide a number by 2 there are only two possible remainders it's either going to be 0 or 1 so for example if we look at a few more examples here so let me just print out a few more module operators and I'll do 2 mod 2 3 mod 2 4 mod 2 and 5 mod 2 so if we run this then we can see that 2 goes into 2 once with no remainders that's why we get a 0 2 goes into 3 once with 1 as a remainder so 2 goes into 4 twice with no remainder and 2 goes into 5 twice with 1 as a remainder so we can see from this pattern that if you do a mod 2 on any number and there is no remainder and that number is even if you do a mod 2 on any number and the remainder is 1 and that number is odd and that's a pretty common check that you'll use a lot throughout Python programming ok so now let's look at the order of operations just like we would expect we can also use parentheses to change the order of operations just like with normal arithmetic so for example if we were to say let's see 3 times 2 plus 1 and with the normal order of operations we would multiply 3 & 2 which would give us 6 and then we would add 1 which would give us 7 so if we run that then we can see that we got 7 as our answer but if I put a parentheses here around this 2 plus 1 and now with normal arithmetic the way that this would work is that it should first add up these numbers in the parentheses which should give us 3 and then 3 times 3 should give 9 so now if we run this then we can see that we got 9 so the order of operations does work correctly within Python like we would expect ok so now let's look at another common operation that you'll see a lot and that is incrementing a variable so if I make a variable here called num and I set this equal to 1 then what are some ways that we can increment that value by one well one way that we could do this is to say that num is equal to num plus 1 and if we print out that num that we can see that it did increment it by 1 and now it's equal to 2 but incrementing values is such a common operation that there is a shorthand for this so instead we can just say num plus equals 1 so if we run that that we can see that it's still incremented at value up to 2 and you can use this syntax with the other operations as well so instead if we were to say num x equals 10 and ran this then we can see that we got 10 because it took our original number and multiplied 1 by 10 okay so a couple more things here we also have some built-in functions available to us to work with numbers and one of these is abs for absolute value and basically this will just remove the sign for many negative numbers so if I took the absolute value of negative 3 and I'll just clean up a couple lines there ok so if we were to print out the absolute value of negative 3 and run that and we can see down here that we just got the absolute value which is 3 now another built-in function that we have is round and by default this will round our values to the nearest integer value so if we said print the round of 3 point 7 5 and run that and we can see that 3 point 7 5 rounded up to 4 and we can also pass a second argument into our round function that tells it how many digits that we want to round to so if I put in a comma here and pass in a 1 as a second argument and now run this and what we're saying is that we want to round to the first digit after the decimal we can see that that rounded 23.8 okay so another common thing that you need to do when working with numbers is to use comparisons now we want to know if two values are equal greater than less than and all of that so to test this we can use comparison operators and I have some comments over here in my snippets with the comparison operators as well and I'm just going to paste over the arithmetic operators that we've already gone over and paste those in now these comparisons are going to return boolean switch our true/false values we'll be learning more about boolean in a future video when we go over conditionals but we'll see them here for the first time so let's say I have two variables here and we'll just call these two variables num1 and set that equal to three and we'll do num2 is equal to two so now let's run through all of these comparisons so first let's say that we wanted to check if these two variables were equal so I could say num1 and you can see up here that the equals comparison is double equals now you don't want to use the single equals because the single equals is this assignment here so the double equals is comparison a single equals as assignment so we want to compare his number 1 equal to num2 and if we run that and we can see that it returns false because those two values are not equal now if I wanted to check if they weren't equal then I could use the exclamation point before the equal sign here exclamation point equals and if we run that that we can see that we got true because these two values are not equal now I can check if num 1 is greater than num2 by using the greater than sign so and save that and run it and we can see that we got true because num1 is 3 number 2 is 2 so 3 is greater than 2 and if you wanted to check less than then you can just use the less than sign so if we run that you can see we got false and you can also use the equal signs with these as well so if I want to check if this was greater than or equal to and we could run that we can see that it's true and if we want to check less than or equal to then we can use those as well and if we print that we can see that we got false ok so now we're going to look at one more thing I'm just going to delete these in order to get some more room now I will have these comments up on my github page if you want to reference to the arithmetic operators and the comparisons that we just looked at okay so in the last video we learned about strings now it's possible that you have something that looks like a number but it could actually be a string so let's look at a problem that we can run into if that's the case and then we'll see how to solve it so let's say that you have some variables that look like numbers so maybe we read these in from a text file or got them from a website or something like that so just to give an example let's recreate our number one but this time we're going to set these equal and single quotes here we'll set this to 100 and num2 we'll set equal to inside single quotes 200 so I explicitly set these equal to strings so it's obvious to us that they're strings but it might not be so obvious to us if we got these values from somewhere else so now let's say that we want to add these values together so if I was to say print num1 plus num2 and if we run this then we can see that this isn't the result that we thought it would be now if you remember from our string video when we add strings together it just concatenates those together so this is what we would expect with strings but with numbers we would expect this to be 300 so in order to turn these into integers we're going to have to do something called casting and casting is super easy and Python so to cast these values from string to integers then we'll just add a couple lines here and I will copy these and we'll just say that num1 equals int num1 so we just casted that to an integer and we can do the same thing here with num2 so now if we save that and run it and we can see that we got three hundred so if you have an integer that's actually a string and you want to cast that to an integer then you can wrap that string in this int function or this int class here to create an integer okay so I think that is going to do it for this video I hope that now you feel comfortable working with integers and floating point values and in the next video we'll be learning about lists sets and tuples which basically allow us to hold sequences of data and is extremely useful to learn how to use properly but if anyone has any questions about what we covered in this video then feel free to ask in the

Once done double click on it in the layers panel to convert it to layer 0 from background layer. After this make a selection around the object which needs to be moved using the polygonal lasso tool from the toolbar on the left. Now press ctrl X to cut the selection area and create a new layer from layers panel. Press ctrl V to paste the object on the new layer. Adjust the position of the object and use the eraser tool to rub off its edges so that it merges with the background. Next go back to layer 0 there will be a patch missing from the image. Make a selection around the patch using the polygonal lasso tool. Now go to the Edit menu at the top and select fill from this list of options. When the dialog box appears set the use to content-aware mode to normal opacity to 100% and press ok. Photoshop will now automatically fill the missing patch. If the patch is too large apply this option in 2 or 3 parts. You can then use the smudge tool to even out the area. In the end select both layers and press ctrl e to merge them.\n",

First one it's a small square package and I picked this great turquoise paper with the red Cardinals to start. First of all make sure your paper covers your package. So this one's a little bit longer. So we need to just cut off the additional we're not going to use. On the sides of your package make sure it's a little bit less than the height of your box. So we're going to trim up. Then from that with correct get the length on your paper correct. And trim that up. Now you have the right size of paper pull over the box tape. Always looks best to seam the paper to so to make sure to get you a nice square. Pull the paper over tape the other side. Then when you're going down on the sides. Press down. Do a nice crease on the sides so it looks sharper. And then fold in again creasing the paper as you go to make sure you have a nice clean finish. And pull the paper tab up get your tape tape there but you've got a nice clean square. The other side doing the same thing press down your paper. Seam press in the sides do your seam pull up and tape. Then again just kind of seemed press down.\n",

This season it was a lot of it was some baby steps of like going back to that route and just placing a lot of gears so i felt super safe and then you know climbing it in the same style that i was going to climb with Alex Simon climbing it but still placing more gear and then during my try this year i actually told Alex because he was he's definitely um more comfortable than almost anyone I know on el cap most people at least feel a little bit of intimidation a little bit of fear like you know there's a little bit of anxiety around it and he's just it's so casual that he was like yeah you should just like you know just run it out like go go all the way like he was basically just wanting me to do it the same way that i was doing it before and I was like you know Alex I’m gonna be a little slower this time like I just I think I need that for my head and so he felt like you should do it with the same amount of gear that you did before just don't fall just don't fall this time Emily yeah kinda real simple a little bit yeah he was like you know but Alex the one thing he always says is he's just like okay follow your heart and i was like okay well I’m gonna go slower. Well just so the audience knows Alex told me that he did a route once and, on his way up realized that he hadn't brought any chalk. So, he had to borrow it from someone else he was strapped to ropes so he's free soloing yeah, no chalk yeah says hey uh i don't have any chalk and the guy gives him a bag and said he left the bag at the top so that when they got to the top, they could retrieve the bag yeah that's a classic Alex situation yeah what like how do you not bring like if you lift weights, you like chalk it's like it's very important for me to get a good grip kind of obsessed with having chalk I don't have chalk I just won't go climbing i just can't imagine but you know I think he's the type of person that um you know going back to like talking about heart rate like I bet I bet when he's in those types of situations like he's so relaxed and his heart rate is so low and he's just he's a different I  think he's truly unique you know and i i think i i think that he just has a different like even brain chemistry than than a lot of us in terms of like how he feels fear and how he can maintain that composure in a very dangerous situation. Well he's remarkably calm all the time yeah like he just seems always like on this one plane yeah he's got like this like 55 beats per minute that he just stays at all the time yep and it's great climbing with him actually because it kind of rubs off on me a little bit like when i climb with Alex i feel more confident I feel more capable I tend to climb better um even though he kind of gives me all the time for being nervous he's always like you're always nervous like you're you're always stressing out but it's actually when I’m with him I’m like you know what i i can chill out a little bit i can like i can i can be on that wavelength a little bit more so that's part of the reason why i like climbing with him up there and why I chose him for this project well that makes sense i mean i guess when you're around people that are if you're doing a thing and you're around people that are excellent at that thing it's contagious or at least inspirational yeah i mean i think it's important to like do yeah to practice practice things you want to be better at with people who are better than you yeah for sure episodes of the joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify that's right they're free from September 1st to December 1st they're going to be available everywhere but after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify but they will  l be free that includes the video the video will also be there it'll also be free that's all we're asking just go download Spotify much love.\n",

        "#   When I was 27 years old,I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher I made quizzes and tests.I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back .I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students? We partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs? And who's going to earn the most money? In all those very different contexts,one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it. Every day parents and teachers ask me, How do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long run? The honest answer is, I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset. This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier.Thank you.\n",
